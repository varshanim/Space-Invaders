# Space Invaders

Space Invaders is a classic arcade game where the player controls a spaceship and tries to defend Earth from invading aliens. The game features retro-style graphics and simple yet addictive gameplay. This README.md file provides an overview of the game and instructions for running and playing it.

# Controls
* Use the left and right arrow keys to move your spaceship horizontally.
* Press the spacebar to shoot lasers at the aliens.

# Gameplay
The objective of Space Invaders is to eliminate all the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen. You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, and you can move it left or right to dodge the aliens' attacks. The aliens will slowly descend towards you, and if any of them reach the bottom, the game is over. You can shoot lasers at the aliens to destroy them. The aliens also shoot back, so be careful! If your spaceship collides with an alien's laser or an alien itself, you will lose a life. You start the game with three lives, and each time you lose a life, your spaceship will be respawned.
